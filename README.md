# Shoes Nike and Adidas Recognitions

## Objectiv
This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that can accurately predict the brand of shoes, whether it's Adidas or Nike, based on visual analysis of shoe images

## Tools & Technology
- Python
- Jupiter notebook
- Tensorflow
- Keras

## Result
The initial model was created using the sequential API without Data Augmentation. The initial results showed a Test Loss of 2.5127 and Test Accuracy of 0.5667. After applying transfer learning, there was a slight improvement in the Test Loss to 1.0739 and Test Accuracy to 0.6333. However, the final model is not yet suitable for deployment as further optimization is needed. Future model improvement can be achieved by augmenting the training data, enhancing data preprocessing, and conducting thorough hyperparameter tuning.
